# Algorithm-Tutorials-in-Dafny
This repo will teach you about how to code algorithms using asserstions. In this repo there are 3 alorithms and each includes a PDF about how to install dafny, how some basic asserstions work and about each algorithm. It also contains 2 files for each algorithm, the incorrect verion can be used to teach yourself about the algorthm because by solving it you should understand how the algorithm works.
